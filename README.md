# Comp.Vis.Algo for Representatives Selection

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of algorithms for selecting representative frames from videos and representative images from datasets, focusing on the SMRS (Sparse Modeling Representative Selection) algorithm. These methods are useful for data compression, video summarization, and dataset representation by identifying a subset of elements that best represent the entire dataset.

## Features

- Extract representative frames from video sequences using MATLAB.
- Select representative images from large image datasets.
- Implementations based on the SMRS algorithm for optimal representative selection.
- Adaptable to various types of data and applications, including video processing, image analysis, and data compression.

### Acknowledgment

This repository implements the SMRS (Sparse Modeling Representative Selection) algorithm, which was originally developed by Ehsan Elhamifar, Ren√© Vidal, and Guillermo Sapiro in their paper **"See All by Looking at a Few: Sparse Modeling for Finding Representative Objects"**. The algorithm presented in this repository is a re-implementation and adaptation of their work.

## Installation
